# Tutorials

In this section, you learn the features of Lightning-Boost using several hands-on deep learning examples.


## MNIST Classification

This is one of the simplest, but for newbees yet impressive classification problems:
Given the greyscale image of a digit between zero and nine, predict the depicted digit as an integer number.
In deep learning circles, it has gained almost the status of a *Hello World* problem, which is why we present it as introducing tutorial for Lightning-Boost.

## Cross-Validation

Cross-validation is an effective technique to mitigate the effects of selection bias when training a deep learning model.
In this tutorial, we show how to perform cross-validation in Lightning-Boost with minimal effort.
